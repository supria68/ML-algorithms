# Regularized Linear Regression with Bias - Variance tradeoff

### Packages:
Numpy, Scipy (minimize, io)

Use either pip install <> or conda install <> for getting the packages.

### Dataset:
Data is taken from course "Machine learning by Stanford University, Coursera".  
ex5data1.mat -> (training,cross validation and testing sets)

### Notebook:
This notebook is dedicated to study the effects of bias/variance on the prediction of the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir, examine the learning algorithm by applying several diagonistics.

### Result:
Training accuracy : 96.43 %
