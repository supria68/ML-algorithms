# Recognizing handwritten digits using Neural Network

### Packages:  
Numpy, Scipy.io
  
Use either pip install <> or conda install <> for getting the packages.
  
### Datasets:  
All .mat files in the ./Data/ folder are taken from course "Machine learning by Stanford University, Coursera".  
ex3data1.mat -> 5000 sets of handwritten digits  
ex3weights.mat -> Weights for neural network model
  
### Script description:  
1. basicFunctions.py :  
This script contains list of functions to compute sigmoid, hiddenlayer activation units.
2. handwrittenDigitClassify.ipynb :  
Notebook uses functions from "basicFunctions.py" to train and evaluate predictions.  
  
### Result:
Training accuracy of Neural Network with given weights: 97.52%
