# Binary Classification using Logistic Regression

## Packages used:  
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn   
  
Use either pip install <> or conda install <> to get the packages.  
  
### Problem 1: (Titanic_Binary_Classification.ipynb)
A classic example of Binary Classification is the titanic dataset. Create a model to predict whether person survived the crash or not.  

#### Procedure:
1. Load the dataset and visualize  
2. Data cleaning (check for missing values, find a way to fill NaN)  
3. Create categorical features for the dataset  
4. Split the data into features and target  
5. Perform feature scaling  
6. Train a logistic regression model  
7. Make predictions on the test features  
8. Evaluate the performance of the model using confusion matrix.  
  
#### Result:
Accuracy of Logistic classifier implemented on test input 81.27 %   

### Problem 2: (AdClick_Binary_Classification.ipynb)
Given a synthetic dataset from an advertisement company, create a model to predict whether an ad gets clicked or not.  

#### Procedure:
1. Load the dataset and visualize 
2. Split the data into features and target
3. Train a logistic regression model
4. Make predictions on the test features
5. Evaluate the performance of the model using Metrics.

#### Result:
Accuracy of Logistic classifier implemented on test input 91.0 %
