# Logistic Regression and Regularization

### Packages:  
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot  
  
Use either pip install <> or conda install <> for getting the packages.  

### Datasets:  
All .txt files in the ./Data/ folder are taken from course "Machine learning by Stanford University, Coursera".  
ex2data1.txt -> Binary Classification (Student marks vs admission)    
ex2data2.txt -> Logistic Regularisation (Microchip quality test)  

### Script description:
1. basicFunctions.py :  
This script contains list of functions to compute hypothesis, gradient and cost for a Logistic Classifier (with and without regularization).   
2. binaryClassification.py :  
An example of logistic classifier using dataset "ex2data1.txt".  
3. LogisticRegularization.py :  
An example of solving overfitting problems in classification algorithms using dataset "ex2data2.txt".
