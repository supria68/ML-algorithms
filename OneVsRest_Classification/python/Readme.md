# One Vs Rest Classification Algorithm

### Packages:
Numpy, Scipy (fmin_tnc, io)  
  
Use either pip install <> or conda install <> for getting the packages.  

### Dataset:  
Data is taken from course "Machine learning by Stanford University, Coursera".  
Data/ex3data1.mat -> Multivariate Logistic regression (handwritten digit image dataset)  

### Script description:
OneVsRest.py :  
The script contains functions to generate hypothesis (sigmoid function), cost, gradient. 
It trains the logistic classifier with the given dataset for all 10 classes and predicts for the randomly chosen test input.

### Result:
Training accuracy : 74.6 %
