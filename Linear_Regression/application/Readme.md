# Linear Regression for a synthetic dataset

### Packages used:
Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn  
  
Use either pip install <> or conda install <> to get the packages.

### Problem Description:
Given a synthetic dataset from an ecommerce company, determine on which features should the company invest more money.

### Procedure:
1. Load the dataset into a dataframe.  
2. Separate the features (X) from the target (y).  
3. Visualize the dataset (X, y).  
4. Split the data into Training and testing sets.  
5. Train the linear model on the training sets.  
6. Get the intercept and coefficients.  
7. Predict the targets from trained model for test features.  
8. Evaluate whether the prediction is equal to test targets.  

### Result:
The coefficients from the trained model helps to find the features on which the company should invest more.
